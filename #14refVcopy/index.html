    // Let's say we have an array

    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    //const team = players;
    //console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    //team[3] = 'lux';

    // now here is the problem!

    //console.log(team);
    //console.log(players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way

    const teamSplice = players.slice();
    //console.log(teamSplice);
    teamSplice[3] = 'lux';
    //console.log(players);
    //console.log(teamSplice);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const teamConcat = [].concat(players);
    //console.log(teamConcat);
    teamConcat[3] = 'lux';
    //console.log(players);
    //console.log(teamConcat);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const teamSpread = [...players];
    //console.log(teamSpread);
    teamSpread[3] = 'lux';
    //console.log(players);
    //console.log(teamSpread);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    //const captain = person;
    //captain.age = 90;
    //console.log(person.age);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99})
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);
    console.log(person.age);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread - not avail yet
    
    //const capt3 = {...person};

    //You can use Object.assign, but....
    console.clear();

    const nev = {
      name: "Neville",

    console.log(nifty);
    console.log(nev);
    nifty.name = "nifty";
    console.log(nifty);
    console.log(nev);

    // ...this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. Below this its a reference not a copy - meaning a change to the clone also changes the original

    nifty.social.twitter = "deep";

    console.log(nifty);
    console.log(nev);

    //lodash has a cloneDeep method need to look up on the Internet, but you should think twice before using it. A poor man's deep clone method - not necc recommended - follows
